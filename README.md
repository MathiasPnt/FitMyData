# FitMyData

To cite this work, see CITATION.cff

Efficient and versatile toolbox for analysis of time-tagged measurements (g2 and HOM), micro-cavities (reflectivity spectrum) and emission (PL). 

The objective is to have a tool to quickly analyse data in the lab. It is not meant to cover all possible possibilities, but we would like this software to be as general as possible. 

What has been implemented so far:
1) Lifetime for exciton (cosine with exp decay) and trion (exp decay)
2) HOM
3) g2
4) Reflectivity spectrum
5) photoluminescence spectrum

Rerquirmements:
Module "HOM_toolbox". Needs to be installed on your current version of python. 
This is a separate project, also available on GitHub.

This code comes with a build in software using streamlit. To run the code:
cd "~FitMyData/"
streamlit run app_FitMyData.py
in your terminal. 

To help me improve this toolbox + software:
!!!DO NOT PUSH OR COMMIT TO MAIN!!!
1) Please create a branch with your _FirstnameLastname for any modifications. 
2) All push should be adding a reasonably small feature to only one of the files.
